# ClockPIC
A boxing GYM Clock using a PIC

It was 2003 and i was asked if i could build a timer/clock of for a boxing gym. {owned by a pretty famous boxer}
Thought why not use a PIC connected to some large LED's and siren.

I used a two push button system to set/start and stop the clock. I pushed most of the design into software - for example instead of a de-bounce circuit i instead used a "timer". Instead of multiple buttons i used "timers" to work out if the person made a quick press or long press - to get into programing mode.  ie: you could change the 3:00minute/30seconds to what ever you wanted.
It worked and was successful. I found that i was asked to make several more - however in the end the construct vs the $$ return wasn't worth it - but the fun factor was certainly worth it.

One thing i did learn was not to put the power supply within the casing. The clocks would be roughly handled and i had one returned with a cracked circuit board.
The inbuilt transformer cracked the board. Version 2 had a rudimentary power pack plugged into the jiffy box instead.

This is the circuit/layout and also the code. Sorry dont have pics of the clocks any more.
